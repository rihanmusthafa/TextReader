👋 Hi, I'm Rihan!
I'm a passionate Python developer and tech enthusiast with a keen interest in image processing, computer vision, and AI-powered automation. I enjoy building tools that turn visual data into meaningful insights — combining logic, creativity, and code.

🛠️ Projects & Skills
Languages & Tools: Python, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, NumPy, Matplotlib

Interests: OCR systems, machine learning, real-time data extraction, image enhancement

Project Highlight:
🔍 TextReader with OpenCV + Tesseract
A Python-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool that processes images to extract text.

Uses image preprocessing (noise removal, thresholding, morphological operations) for better accuracy.

Extracts both printed and handwritten text from images.

Built with OpenCV and Tesseract, and visualizes processing steps with Matplotlib.

🌱 What I’m Learning Now
Currently diving deeper into:

Advanced computer vision techniques

Deep learning-based OCR (like TrOCR)

GitHub workflows and automation
